# Plans Directory

This directory contains detailed feature development plans for Wandora. Each plan provides comprehensive implementation guidance for complex features.

## Purpose

- **Detailed Planning**: Store complex implementation details separate from current state documentation
- **Collaborative Development**: Enable easy review and modification of feature plans
- **Historical Record**: Track how features were planned and implemented
- **Focused Documentation**: Keep CLAUDE.md focused on current state while plans handle future work

## Plan Structure

Each feature plan follows this template:

```markdown
# Feature Name Implementation Plan

## Status
[Planning/In Progress/Completed]

## Overview
Brief description of the feature and its goals

## Technology Requirements
- Dependencies to install
- APIs to integrate
- Environment variables needed

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Setup and infrastructure
2. **Phase 2**: Core functionality
3. **Phase 3**: Integration and testing

## File Structure
```
/new-files/
  ├── component.tsx
  └── utils.ts
```

## Environment Variables
```bash
NEW_API_KEY=value
```

## Testing Strategy
- How to test the implementation
- Edge cases to consider

## CLAUDE.md Updates Required
- What sections to update when complete
- Status changes to make
```

## Current Plans

- **[map-functionality.md](./map-functionality.md)**: Comprehensive map integration using Maptiler SDK

## Workflow

### Creating a New Plan
1. Create a new `.md` file in this directory
2. Follow the plan template structure
3. Reference the plan from CLAUDE.md if appropriate

### Working on a Plan
1. Update the plan status from "Planning" to "In Progress"
2. Check off completed phases as you work
3. Update any technical decisions or changes

### Completing a Plan
1. Update plan status to "Completed"
2. Update CLAUDE.md according to the plan's update requirements
3. Move features from "Planned" to "Completed" in CLAUDE.md

## Integration with CLAUDE.md

- **CLAUDE.md** focuses on current implementation status
- **Plans** contain detailed future implementation guidance
- Plans directory is referenced in CLAUDE.md file structure
- Completed plans inform CLAUDE.md updates

## Benefits

1. **Organization**: Complex features have dedicated planning space
2. **Collaboration**: Plans can be easily reviewed and modified
3. **Traceability**: Clear record of implementation decisions
4. **Maintainability**: Current state and future plans are clearly separated
